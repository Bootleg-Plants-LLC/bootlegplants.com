    <h1>All materials are made from recycled or upcycled materials</h1>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bootleg Plants LLC is a small business making 100% handmade and 100% unique new items from discarded stuff... Turning old crap into new creations! <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspSarah started crafting clothing from unwanted but still usable textiles in 2021 to give second lives to natural fibers. She also incorporated another love: plants.  Feedback was overwhelmingly positive. She has sold her creations at fairs around Maryland. Each item is unique and engineered reclaimed clothing and recyclables. Crafting is a slow and careful process, and the resulting product is a beautiful signature piece that you will feel good wearing and displaying in your home, will reduce your environmental impact, and will catch everyoneâ€™s attention!
